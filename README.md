# Hamming Distance Visualization

[[website](nomomon.github.io/hamming-distance)]

This is a Hamming distance visualizator for integer numbers of length 5. First, the program sorts the numbers in an ascending order. Then, the  distance is computed. The digits that are different are connected with a line, and then an arrow pointing to the right shows the count of these lines between two numbers. For the algorithm to run, there sould be at least two numbers in the list.

The Hamming distance between two numbers is _assumed to be_ the number of different digits in similar decimal places.
